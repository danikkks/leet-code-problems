In this repo I will try to:

-   solve some [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems and [type challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges).
-   improve my knowledge of [design](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) and [other](https://www.patterns.dev/posts) types of patterns

Good luck to me)
